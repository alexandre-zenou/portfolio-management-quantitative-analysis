# Quantitative Portfolio Management

This repository contains a quantitative **portfolio management project** developed as part of the *Portfolio Management* course, under the supervision of **Pierre Brugière**.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to study **portfolio construction and allocation strategies** using financial market data, and to analyze their impact on **risk–return trade-offs** and overall performance.

The project combines financial theory with empirical implementation, focusing on:
- portfolio allocation,
- performance evaluation,
- and robustness analysis through backtesting.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard quantitative portfolio management workflow:
- Data collection and preprocessing of financial time series  
- Construction of portfolios under different allocation strategies  
- Performance evaluation using risk and return metrics  
- Comparative analysis of strategies across time  

The emphasis is placed on understanding how allocation choices affect portfolio behavior rather than on short-term trading.

## Key Concepts

- Portfolio allocation and diversification  
- Risk–return trade-off  
- Performance metrics and backtesting  
- Quantitative analysis of financial data
